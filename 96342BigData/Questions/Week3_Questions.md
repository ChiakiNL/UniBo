##### 1 What is the primary purpose of a randomized control trial (RCT) in social sciences?

##### To observe natural phenomena



**Answer: To test causal relationships between variables**



To conduct qualitative research



To collect survey data



##### 2 In an RCT, what is the key feature that distinguishes it from other research designs?

##### The use of statistical software



**Answer: The random assignment of participants to groups**



The length of the research study



The use of open-ended questions



##### 3 What is random assignment in an RCT?



Assigning participants to groups based on their preferences



Assigning participants to groups based on their age



**Answer: Assigning participants to groups using a random process**



Assigning participants to groups alphabetically



##### 4 Which of the following is a potential benefit of using random assignment in an RCT?



Convenience



Avoidance of ethical concerns



**Answer: Reduction of selection bias**



Greater generalizability





##### 5 In an RCT, the group that receives the treatment or intervention is called the:



**Answer: Experimental group**



Control group



Qualitative group



Observational group



##### 6 What is the term for the phenomenon in which participants who know they are in the control group change their behavior because of that knowledge?



Placebo effect



**Answer: Hawthorne effect**



Selection bias



Randomization bias



##### 7 Which type of RCT design involves multiple measurements taken over an extended period to assess the impact of an intervention?



Cross-sectional RCT



**Answer: Longitudinal RCT**



Retrospective RCT



Exploratory RCT





##### 8 What is the main limitation of using RCTs in social sciences research?



Lack of control over variables



Ethical concerns



Difficulty in obtaining a representative sample



**Answer: Limited external validity**



##### 9 In an RCT, what is the goal of randomization?



To eliminate the need for data analysis



To ensure that all participants receive the same treatment



**Answer: To reduce the likelihood of systematic bias**



To make the study more convenient for researchers



##### 10 External validity concerns the:



Precision of the study's measurements



**Answer: Generalizability of the study's findings to other populations or settings**



Consistency of the treatment effects within the study



Elimination of confounding variables

##### 

##### 11 In the potential outcome framework (POF), the counterfactual outcome refers to:



The observed outcome for the treatment group



**Answer: The unobservable outcome that would have occurred if a participant**

**received a different treatment**



The outcome for participants who were randomly assigned to the control

group



The outcome for participants who were assigned to the treatment group

##### 

##### 12 Internal validity in an RCT refers to:



The extent to which the study's results can be generalized to the broader

population



The accuracy and precision of the measurement instruments used in the

study



**Answer: The degree to which the observed treatment effects are due to the**

**experimental manipulation**



The external factors that may affect the study's outcomes
