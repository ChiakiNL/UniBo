# Big Data: Week4\_Questions



##### 1 What is the main objective of Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimation in the social sciences?

##### 

**Answer:** To identify the impact of a treatment or intervention on an outcome



To calculate the average difference between two groups



To conduct surveys on a specific population



To determine the correlation between two variables



##### 2 Suppose you want to study the effect of a policy on y. Let treated be a dummy variable equal to 1 for individuals in the treatment group and 0 otherwise. After is a dummy equal to 1 if the data is from a period after the policy has been implemented and 0 if not. 

##### 

##### The estimate of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ gives you the estimated \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

##### 

beta1; effect of the policy



beta3; ; general difference between treatment and control group



**Answer:** beta3 ; effect of the policy



##### 3 The difference-in-differences estimator relies on what is known as the parallel trend assumption. This means that there must be no differences in characteristics between the two groups except the policy change.



Yes



**Answer:** No



##### 4 The following statements refer to natural experiments and quasi-experiments that can be exploited in a difference-in-differences estimation procedure. 



##### Choose the correct statement(s).

##### 

In a natural experiment there is always a control group and a treatment

group, which are randomly and explicitly chosen by the researchers.



**Answer:** A natural experiment occurs when an exogenous event changes the

environment in which individuals, families, firms or cities operate.



**Answer:** In order to control for systematic differences between control and

treatment groups, data from at least two time periods is need-one

before the event occurred and one after it took place.



##### 5 Consider the following graph depicting the outcome before and after  a treatment for two groups. Group 1 (Blue) is the treated group; Group 2(Red) is the control group. What is the effect of the treatment?



**Answer:** 15



30



5



70



##### 6 Consider the following graph depicting the outcome before and after  a treatment for two groups. Group 1 (Blue) is the treated group; Group 2(Red) is the control group. What is the counterfactual outcome for the treated group if the treatment would not have occurred?



15



30



5



**Answer:** 70



##### 7 What statistical technique is commonly used in DiD estimation to model treatment effects?



Logistic regression



**Answer:** Linear regression



Chi-squared test



Paired t-test



##### 8 In DiD analysis, what should be the sample size requirement for valid results?



The treatment group must be larger than the control group



Both treatment and control groups should have equal sizes



**Answer:** A minimum of two time points before and after the intervention



A large sample size is not necessary for valid results.





##### 9 What is the primary advantage of DiD estimation compared to simple before-and-after comparisons?



**Answer:** DiD accounts for the fact that outcomes may naturally change over time



DiD is quicker and less resource-intensive.



DiD does not require a control group.



DiD always produces more accurate results.





##### 10 What is the parallel trends assumption in DiD estimation?



**Answer:** It assumes that the treatment and control groups have similar trends

before the intervention.



It assumes that the treatment effect is constant over time



It assumes that the treatment group always outperforms the control

group



It assumes that there is no attrition in the control group
